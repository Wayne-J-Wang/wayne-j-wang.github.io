            The shoulder is a bone in socket joint where the humerous and the sacpula joind. It is a freely movable joint, and in face, the most flexible joint in the human body. However, this large range of motion
            makes it prone to injuries, and one of the most common injuries of the shoulder joint is dislocation. 

            <br/>

            The hip is also a bone in socket joint that allows a large range of motion. At the hips, the femur connects to the pelvis. The most commmon injury of the hips is osteoarthritis, 
            the general wear-and-tear of the cartilage in the hip joint. When the cartilage is worn away, bones rub against bones, resulting in severe pain.

            The knee is a hinge joint where the femur and the tibia join. The patella or the knee cap is another bone present in the knee joint, responsible for protecting the joint. The crucial ligament
            and the collateral ligament hold the knee together. The collateral ligaent is responsible for stability; if one's crucial ligament is teared, then they won't be able to walk, but if one'<s></s>
            collateral ligament is damaged, they can walk but won't be able to change directions.
